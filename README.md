# learn-to-code

Useful material for beginners who wants to learn programming

## Tips

* Most of the tutorial platforms/video players (e.g.: Youtube) has speed up function for video play. It is very useful to speed up video to 1.5x speed (sometimes even 2.0x speed is still understandable) so you could watch content faster (after few seconds brain adapts to faster speaking and it seems that you are listening in normal speed)

* If video touches some topic slightly but does not provide enough details for you google that specific topic or find a video on that topic alone in order to fully understand how it works before continiouing further to other topics.
